### 8 New Vulnerabilites Reported By CISA
CISA reported [8 new vulnerablities today](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog), Apple being hit the hardest with 5 IOS vulnerablities being reported, all of which allowed attackers to execute code in some cases with kernal privlages.

Among the other vulnerbilities reported was a flaw in PopupBlocker affecting Chromium based browsers (such as Edge and Chrome) allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code. While it hasn't been seen in the wild yet, it is rated as having a ***high risk*** to governments and organizations. According to the [CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/advisory/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-google-chrome-could-allow-for-arbitrary-code-execution_2021-073), make sure all your users are ***not*** using chromium based browsers as a user with elevated permissions. This will lessen the impact the attackers ability to excute arbitrary code.
