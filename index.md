### 8 New Vulnerabilites Reported By CISA
CISA reported 8 new vulnerablities today, Apple being hit the hardest with 5 IOS vulnerablities being reported, all of which allowed attackers to execute code in some cases with kernal privlages.

Among the other vulnerbilities reported was a flaw in PopupBlocker affecting Chromium based browsers (such as Edge and Chrome) allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code. While it hasn't been seen in the wild yet, it is rated as having a high risk to governments and organizations. While we wait for a patch to be released, make sure all your users are **not** using chromium based browsers as an elevated user. This will lessen the impact the attackers ability to excute arbitrary code.
